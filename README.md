# Web-Development

  This repository contains my whole web development course journey. This also includes my final project which can be found in "Node" folder. Technologies which are used throughout this repo are JavaScript, Mongo and Express. Session based authentication has also been added. This repository can help you in your web development journey. Clone the repo and play around with the project, customize the CSS and layout to make this your own project. Feel free to contact me if you have any queries.
